## Files and Usage

### 1. `count_lines.sh`
- **Purpose**: Counts the number of lines in specified file types.
- **Features**:
  - Supports recursive search.
  - Customizable file extensions and target directory.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./count_lines.sh [options]
  ```
  Options:
  - `-d <directory>`: Set the target directory (default: current directory).
  - `-e <extensions>`: Comma-separated list of file extensions (default: `.c,.h,.asm,.sh,.md`).

### 2. `gitkeep.sh`
- **Purpose**: Adds `.gitkeep` files to all empty directories in a Git repository.
- **Features**:
  - Ensures empty directories are tracked in Git.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./gitkeep.sh
  ```
- **Output**: Automatically stages `.gitkeep` files.

### 3. `read-tree.sh`
- **Purpose**: Generates a log file (`tree.log`) containing the directory structure and the contents of human-readable files.
- **Features**:
  - Excludes `.git` directories by default.
  - Supports a `.treeignore` file for additional exclusions.
  - Reads human-readable file contents into the log.
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  ./read-tree.sh [target_directory]
  ```
- **Output**:
  - Logs the directory structure and readable file contents to `tree.log`.

### 4. `tree.log`
- **Purpose**: Auto-generated log by `read-tree.sh`.
- **Contents**:
  - Directory structure.
  - Contents of human-readable files, excluding ignored files.

## Example `.treeignore` File

To customize excluded files and directories for `read-tree.sh`, create a `.treeignore` file in the target directory. Example:

```plaintext
# Ignore log files
*.log

# Ignore temporary files
*.tmp

# Ignore specific directories
node_modules
build/
```
